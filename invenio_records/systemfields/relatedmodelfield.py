"""Related model field.

The related model field serializes/dumps a related object into the record JSON
dictionary (basically denormalization). This way, the object can be recreated
directly from the record JSON dictionary instead of querying the database.

This is useful for instance during search queries to avoid hitting the
database. In addition you can subclass this field to provide life-cycle hooks
on the record. For instance a PIDField, could create the related persistent
identifier.
